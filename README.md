# use-of-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-text-generation
GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) define a new research line in the generative modelling field. This new paradigm showed impressive results in the computer vision field when they were applied to generate new images from a real data set. Some studies reported results whose generations are clearly indistinguishable from real images to the human eye.  Despite that, they have not been broadly applied to generate discrete sequences (e.g. text). One of the most reported issues when generating text using generative adversarial networks is the difficulty that they have of dealing with discrete generations which, indeed, is the nature of text.  The goal of this project is to study how GANs can be applied to generate free text and which are the advantages and disadvantages over other common approaches. The best results obtained have been properly reported and quantified.Tatoeba corpus was selected as the main dataset for this effort. Tatoeba is a large open-source and free collection of sentences written in multiple languages which is intended to be a powerful resource for natural language processing tasks
